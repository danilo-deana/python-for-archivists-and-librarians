Verbal alterations or expansions of phrase, reflecting second thoughts, are few, but do occur (see, e.g, vol. 1, ff. 70, 139, 225, 228; vol. II, ff. 1, 8; vol.

First published, in 3 vols, on 26 Oct. 1849 as Shirley. A Tale. By Currer Bell, Author of 'Jane Eyre'. The manuscript was originally written as one volume, the pages being numbered consecutively throughout, viz. 1-284 (= Vol. IV), 285-573 (= vol. V), and 574-891 (= vol. VI), and the chapters being similarly treated (vol. V opens with the original chap. ii, vol. VI with chap. 23). Verbal alterations (and deletions) are more numerous than in the manuscript of 'Jane Eyre' (see, e.g, vol. IV, ff. 7, 18, 35, 38, 54, 83, 100; V, ff. 5, 7, 12, 80, 211; Vol. VI, ff. 1, 7, 22, 66, 171. In vol. IV the second paragraph (in chap. 1) was redrafted; the Sykes family was given originally the name of Roakes (see ff. 27, 28, 78, 97, 109, 147) and in one place (f. 31) the original name has remained unaltered at its second appearance on the page and thus appears in the printed text (P. 31). Moreover, chap. 4 (f. 59) was wrongly numbered chap. 3, an error repeated by the printer, though the number ofthe next chapter appears correctly in both the MS. (f. 76) and the printed text as 5. Other alterations in vol. iv are the substitution of 'Canadian' for 'American' (f.201) and of' 'Cliffbridge' for 'Scarbro'(f.267). A leaf is missing between ff. 214 and 216; the blank leaf substituted was in its present position when the manuscript was received in the British Museum. In vol. VI the original title of chap. 4 (= MS. chap. 26) was 'Le Cheval dompt@', which became in the printed text, 'The First Blue-Stocking', and that of chap. 9 (= MS. chap. 30) was 'Martin Yorke meets a Wood-Nymph', altered in the MS. to that adopted in the printed text, viz. 'The School-boy and the Woodnymph'. A footnote reference on f. 203, 'See Preface', shows that a preface was at one time projected. Signatures and first-leaf numbers of the gatherings of the printed text are usually indicated in the manuscript, as also the compositors' names, but there are several omissions. Paper. Three volumes.

First published, in 3 vols, On 28 Jan. 1853 as Villette. By Currer Bell, Author of 'Jane Eyre', 'Shirley', etc. The manuscript, like those of the two preceding novels, was originally in one volume, the folios being numbered consecutively throughout, viz. 1-272 (=vol. VII), 273-546 (=vol. VIII), and 546 (lower portion of page)-847 (=vol. IX), and the chapters being similarly treated (vol. VIII opens with the original chap. 17 and vol. IX with chap. 30). Many pages have been mutilated, and a memorandum on the flyleaf (f. 1), dated 22 Dec. 1896, notes those in vol. VII and records the fact that the original f. 216 was missing at that date. Verbal alterations (some in pencil, e.g, vol. VIII, f. 237) are numerous and several chapter-titles were altered: thus, in vol. VIII the original title of chap. 17, 'La Terrasse', was replaced by 'Auld Langsyne' and transferred to chap. 18, the original title of which, 'The Second Evening', is deleted; this may be connected with the fact that the first printed volume was presumably intended to end with chap. 17 (see f. 24, ad fin.). In vol. IX 'Fraternity', in pencil, is substituted for 'Fraternal Covenant' at the head of chap. 37. Chap. 38 is entitled 'Malign Aspect' ('Apple of Discord' in the printed edition). A number of titles throughout have been added in pencil (e.g. vol. VIII, chaps. 25, 26, 27). Chap. 41 has no title at all. As elsewhere in these MSS. the signatures and first-leaf numbers of the gatherings of the printed text are (with some omissions) indicated throughout. In vol. IX, ff. 609 (lower portion), the whole of 610-616, and upper part of 617 (by original foliation) are missing, but the text runs on as in the printed version; in the same volume a portion of the original f. 633 has been misplaced between ff. 770 and 771 (see printed text pp. go-gi). The character Lucy Snowe was originally named Lucy Frost (see, e.g, vol.VII, f. 48; vol. VIII, f. 21). Paper. Three volumes. Quarto. A.D. 1852. The MS. is referred to in T. J.

"MISCELLANEOUS original letters, etc.:-. A. Letters of Charles II. (a) to an unnamed nobleman, hoping to find in him ' a principle instrument ' towards bis restoration, and assuring him of reward; Paris, 10 Mar. 1654. f. 1;-(b) to ' Mr Rumball ' William Rumbold, thanking him for his constancy and desiring him to do his utmost to procure contributions for his support;. Cologne, 4 June, 1655. f. 3. Holograph. From the Farnborough Fund. B. 1. ''Air composé expressément pour le début de Duprez dans ''les Huguenots,'' par Meyerbeer, qui lui a envoyé, écrite de sa main, I''ébauche ci-incluse. - Cet air inedit a été chanté 10 fois par Duprez - en 1837 - et supprimé comme inutile.'' The above description is signed ''Gilbert Duprez'', for whom it was written in 1837. The music was written for insertion in Act v of the Opera, as an alternative to the original setting of the scene beginning ''Il I''aura! oui. Courons aux armes,'' following the air ''A la lueur de leurs torches,'' as published in 1836. The melody only of the first part of the air is given, but the second portion of it has the pianoforte part written under it, in score, followed by a neat copy of the same. ff. 6-9. 2. ''Amen'': Canon for 4 voices, in score, by Thomas Attwood. A shortened version of the same is given, also in the composer''s hand, in Add MS 35026, f. 16, of which the probable date is 1837. f. 11. From the Farnborough Fund. C. 1. Fragment of the first act of the second part of 'Faust,' by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; circ. 1830? . Autograph. On a single paper leaf. It contains the four stanzas of the first chorus, 'Wenn sich lau die Lüfte füllen,' and the song of Ariel which follows, ending ' Trifft es euch so seyd ihr taub.' The only complete variation from the text of G. von Loeper (Berlin, 1870) is the stage-direction preceding Ariel''s song, '(Die Sonne geht auf). Faust erwacht.' for '(Ungeheures Getöse verkündet das Herannahen der Sonne).' There are a few corrections; one in the last line of the chorus is made upon a slip pasted down, a habit of the poet, as asserted by Johann Peter Eckermann, author of the Gespräche mit Goethe, in a letter dated Weimar, 14 July, 1853, attached by seal to the above. f. 12. 2. Letter from ' Currer Bell ' Charlotte Brontë to W. S.
