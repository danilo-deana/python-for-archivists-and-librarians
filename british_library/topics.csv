The above description is signed ''Gilbert Duprez'', for whom it was written in 1837. The music was written for insertion in Act v of the Opera, as an alternative to the original setting of the scene beginning ''Il I''aura! oui. Courons aux armes,'' following the air ''A la lueur de leurs torches,'' as published in 1836. The melody only of the first part of the air is given, but the second portion of it has the pianoforte part written under it, in score, followed by a neat copy of the same. ff. 6-9. 2. ''Amen'': Canon for 4 voices, in score, by Thomas Attwood. A shortened version of the same is given, also in the composer''s hand, in Add MS 35026, f. 16, of which the probable date is 1837. f. 11. From the Farnborough Fund. C. 1. Fragment of the first act of the second part of 'Faust,' by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; circ. 1830? . Autograph. On a single paper leaf. It contains the four stanzas of the first chorus, 'Wenn sich lau die Lüfte füllen,' and the song of Ariel which follows, ending ' Trifft es euch so seyd ihr taub.' The only complete variation from the text of G. von Loeper (Berlin, 1870) is the stage-direction preceding Ariel''s song, '(Die Sonne geht auf). Faust erwacht.' for '(Ungeheures Getöse verkündet das Herannahen der Sonne).' There are a few corrections; one in the last line of the chorus is made upon a slip pasted down, a habit of the poet, as asserted by Johann Peter Eckermann, author of the Gespräche mit Goethe, in a letter dated Weimar, 14 July, 1853, attached by seal to the above. f. 12. 2.

Letters of Charles II. (a) to an unnamed nobleman, hoping to find in him ' a principle instrument ' towards bis restoration, and assuring him of reward; Paris, 10 Mar. 1654. f. 1;-(b) to ' Mr Rumball ' William Rumbold, thanking him for his constancy and desiring him to do his utmost to procure contributions for his support;. Cologne, 4 June, 1655. f. 3. Holograph. From the Farnborough Fund. B. 1. ''Air composé expressément pour le début de Duprez dans ''les Huguenots,'' par Meyerbeer, qui lui a envoyé, écrite de sa main, I''ébauche ci-incluse. - Cet air inedit a été chanté 10 fois par Duprez - en 1837 - et supprimé comme inutile.'' The above description is signed ''Gilbert Duprez'', for whom it was written in 1837. The music was written for insertion in Act v of the Opera, as an alternative to the original setting of the scene beginning ''Il I''aura! oui. Courons aux armes,'' following the air ''A la lueur de leurs torches,'' as published in 1836. The melody only of the first part of the air is given, but the second portion of it has the pianoforte part written under it, in score, followed by a neat copy of the same. ff. 6-9. 2. ''Amen'': Canon for 4 voices, in score, by Thomas Attwood. A shortened version of the same is given, also in the composer''s hand, in Add MS 35026, f. 16, of which the probable date is 1837. f. 11. From the Farnborough Fund. C. 1. Fragment of the first act of the second part of 'Faust,' by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; circ. 1830? . Autograph. On a single paper leaf. It contains the four stanzas of the first chorus, 'Wenn sich lau die Lüfte füllen,' and the song of Ariel which follows, ending ' Trifft es euch so seyd ihr taub.' The only complete variation from the text of G. von Loeper (Berlin, 1870) is the stage-direction preceding Ariel''s song, '(Die Sonne geht auf). Faust erwacht.' for '(Ungeheures Getöse verkündet das Herannahen der Sonne).' There are a few corrections; one in the last line of the chorus is made upon a slip pasted down, a habit of the poet, as asserted by Johann Peter Eckermann, author of the Gespräche mit Goethe, in a letter dated Weimar, 14 July, 1853, attached by seal to the above. f. 12. 2. Letter from ' Currer Bell ' Charlotte Brontë to W. S. Williams, the publisher''s reader responsible for the acceptance of ' Jane Eyre,' with remarks on the life of a governess, on Carlyle''s style, etc; 15 June, 1848. f. 14. Paper; ff. 15.

Letters of Charles II. (a) to an unnamed nobleman, hoping to find in him ' a principle instrument ' towards bis restoration, and assuring him of reward; Paris, 10 Mar. 1654. f. 1;-(b) to ' Mr Rumball ' William Rumbold, thanking him for his constancy and desiring him to do his utmost to procure contributions for his support;. Cologne, 4 June, 1655. f. 3. Holograph. From the Farnborough Fund. B. 1. ''Air composé expressément pour le début de Duprez dans ''les Huguenots,'' par Meyerbeer, qui lui a envoyé, écrite de sa main, I''ébauche ci-incluse. - Cet air inedit a été chanté 10 fois par Duprez - en 1837 - et supprimé comme inutile.'' The above description is signed ''Gilbert Duprez'', for whom it was written in 1837. The music was written for insertion in Act v of the Opera, as an alternative to the original setting of the scene beginning ''Il I''aura! oui. Courons aux armes,'' following the air ''A la lueur de leurs torches,'' as published in 1836. The melody only of the first part of the air is given, but the second portion of it has the pianoforte part written under it, in score, followed by a neat copy of the same. ff. 6-9. 2. ''Amen'': Canon for 4 voices, in score, by Thomas Attwood. A shortened version of the same is given, also in the composer''s hand, in Add MS 35026, f. 16, of which the probable date is 1837. f. 11. From the Farnborough Fund. C. 1. Fragment of the first act of the second part of 'Faust,' by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; circ. 1830? . Autograph. On a single paper leaf. It contains the four stanzas of the first chorus, 'Wenn sich lau die Lüfte füllen,' and the song of Ariel which follows, ending ' Trifft es euch so seyd ihr taub.' The only complete variation from the text of G. von Loeper (Berlin, 1870) is the stage-direction preceding Ariel''s song, '(Die Sonne geht auf). Faust erwacht.' for '(Ungeheures Getöse verkündet das Herannahen der Sonne).' There are a few corrections; one in the last line of the chorus is made upon a slip pasted down, a habit of the poet, as asserted by Johann Peter Eckermann, author of the Gespräche mit Goethe, in a letter dated Weimar, 14 July, 1853, attached by seal to the above. f. 12. 2. Letter from ' Currer Bell ' Charlotte Brontë to W. S.

Letters of Charles II. (a) to an unnamed nobleman, hoping to find in him ' a principle instrument ' towards bis restoration, and assuring him of reward; Paris, 10 Mar. 1654. f. 1;-(b) to ' Mr Rumball ' William Rumbold, thanking him for his constancy and desiring him to do his utmost to procure contributions for his support;. Cologne, 4 June, 1655. f. 3. Holograph. From the Farnborough Fund. B. 1. ''Air composé expressément pour le début de Duprez dans ''les Huguenots,'' par Meyerbeer, qui lui a envoyé, écrite de sa main, I''ébauche ci-incluse. - Cet air inedit a été chanté 10 fois par Duprez - en 1837 - et supprimé comme inutile.'' The above description is signed ''Gilbert Duprez'', for whom it was written in 1837. The music was written for insertion in Act v of the Opera, as an alternative to the original setting of the scene beginning ''Il I''aura! oui. Courons aux armes,'' following the air ''A la lueur de leurs torches,'' as published in 1836. The melody only of the first part of the air is given, but the second portion of it has the pianoforte part written under it, in score, followed by a neat copy of the same. ff. 6-9. 2. ''Amen'': Canon for 4 voices, in score, by Thomas Attwood. A shortened version of the same is given, also in the composer''s hand, in Add MS 35026, f. 16, of which the probable date is 1837. f. 11. From the Farnborough Fund. C. 1. Fragment of the first act of the second part of 'Faust,' by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; circ. 1830? . Autograph. On a single paper leaf. It contains the four stanzas of the first chorus, 'Wenn sich lau die Lüfte füllen,' and the song of Ariel which follows, ending ' Trifft es euch so seyd ihr taub.' The only complete variation from the text of G. von Loeper (Berlin, 1870) is the stage-direction preceding Ariel''s song, '(Die Sonne geht auf). Faust erwacht.' for '(Ungeheures Getöse verkündet das Herannahen der Sonne).' There are a few corrections; one in the last line of the chorus is made upon a slip pasted down, a habit of the poet, as asserted by Johann Peter Eckermann, author of the Gespräche mit Goethe, in a letter dated Weimar, 14 July, 1853, attached by seal to the above. f. 12. 2. Letter from ' Currer Bell ' Charlotte Brontë to W. S.

Letters of Charles II. (a) to an unnamed nobleman, hoping to find in him ' a principle instrument ' towards bis restoration, and assuring him of reward; Paris, 10 Mar. 1654. f. 1;-(b) to ' Mr Rumball ' William Rumbold, thanking him for his constancy and desiring him to do his utmost to procure contributions for his support;. Cologne, 4 June, 1655. f. 3. Holograph. From the Farnborough Fund. B. 1. ''Air composé expressément pour le début de Duprez dans ''les Huguenots,'' par Meyerbeer, qui lui a envoyé, écrite de sa main, I''ébauche ci-incluse. - Cet air inedit a été chanté 10 fois par Duprez - en 1837 - et supprimé comme inutile.'' The above description is signed ''Gilbert Duprez'', for whom it was written in 1837. The music was written for insertion in Act v of the Opera, as an alternative to the original setting of the scene beginning ''Il I''aura! oui. Courons aux armes,'' following the air ''A la lueur de leurs torches,'' as published in 1836. The melody only of the first part of the air is given, but the second portion of it has the pianoforte part written under it, in score, followed by a neat copy of the same. ff. 6-9. 2. ''Amen'': Canon for 4 voices, in score, by Thomas Attwood. A shortened version of the same is given, also in the composer''s hand, in Add MS 35026, f. 16, of which the probable date is 1837. f. 11. From the Farnborough Fund. C. 1. Fragment of the first act of the second part of 'Faust,' by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; circ. 1830? . Autograph. On a single paper leaf. It contains the four stanzas of the first chorus, 'Wenn sich lau die Lüfte füllen,' and the song of Ariel which follows, ending ' Trifft es euch so seyd ihr taub.' The only complete variation from the text of G. von Loeper (Berlin, 1870) is the stage-direction preceding Ariel''s song, '(Die Sonne geht auf). Faust erwacht.' for '(Ungeheures Getöse verkündet das Herannahen der Sonne).' There are a few corrections; one in the last line of the chorus is made upon a slip pasted down, a habit of the poet, as asserted by Johann Peter Eckermann, author of the Gespräche mit Goethe, in a letter dated Weimar, 14 July, 1853, attached by seal to the above. f. 12. 2. Letter from ' Currer Bell ' Charlotte Brontë to W. S.

Cologne, 4 June, 1655. f. 3. Holograph. From the Farnborough Fund. B. 1. ''Air composé expressément pour le début de Duprez dans ''les Huguenots,'' par Meyerbeer, qui lui a envoyé, écrite de sa main, I''ébauche ci-incluse. - Cet air inedit a été chanté 10 fois par Duprez - en 1837 - et supprimé comme inutile.'' The above description is signed ''Gilbert Duprez'', for whom it was written in 1837. The music was written for insertion in Act v of the Opera, as an alternative to the original setting of the scene beginning ''Il I''aura! oui. Courons aux armes,'' following the air ''A la lueur de leurs torches,'' as published in 1836. The melody only of the first part of the air is given, but the second portion of it has the pianoforte part written under it, in score, followed by a neat copy of the same. ff. 6-9. 2. ''Amen'': Canon for 4 voices, in score, by Thomas Attwood. A shortened version of the same is given, also in the composer''s hand, in Add MS 35026, f. 16, of which the probable date is 1837. f. 11. From the Farnborough Fund. C. 1. Fragment of the first act of the second part of 'Faust,' by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; circ. 1830? . Autograph. On a single paper leaf. It contains the four stanzas of the first chorus, 'Wenn sich lau die Lüfte füllen,' and the song of Ariel which follows, ending ' Trifft es euch so seyd ihr taub.' The only complete variation from the text of G. von Loeper (Berlin, 1870) is the stage-direction preceding Ariel''s song, '(Die Sonne geht auf). Faust erwacht.' for '(Ungeheures Getöse verkündet das Herannahen der Sonne).' There are a few corrections; one in the last line of the chorus is made upon a slip pasted down, a habit of the poet, as asserted by Johann Peter Eckermann, author of the Gespräche mit Goethe, in a letter dated Weimar, 14 July, 1853, attached by seal to the above. f. 12. 2.
